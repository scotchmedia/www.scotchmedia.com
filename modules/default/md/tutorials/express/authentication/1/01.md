## Managing User Accounts

### Overview
#### What we will be building
In this Chapter we will be building a User centric applcation. Topic
covered include:

- Setting up and configuring a database
- Writing test with mocha and mongoose
- Creating a User Model
- Managing User sessions
- User authentication
- Sending Emails
- Password Recovery

#### What we will be using

To accomplish these goals we will be using the following open source
projects:

- [express](http://expressjs.com) - web application framework for node
- [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) - A little supervisor script for nodejs. It runs your program, and watches for code changes, so you can have hot-code reloading-ish behavior, without worrying about memory leaks and making sure you clean up all the inter-module references, and without a whole new require system
- [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha) - Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node and the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun
- [mongoddb](http://www.mongodb.org) - MongoDB (from "humongous") is a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database
- [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) - elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js
- [Passport](http://passportjs.org) - Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js
- [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) - BDD style assertions for node.js -- test framework agnostic
- [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) - Super-agent driven library for testing node.js HTTP servers using a fluent API
