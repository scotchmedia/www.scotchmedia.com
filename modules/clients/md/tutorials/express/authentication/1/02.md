### Setup
#### Creating an express app

1. Install express

    ```
    npm install express -g
    ```

2. Initiate a new app

    ```bash
    express --sessions storeski
    ```

    This will create the foundation for your application. For complete list of express option type `express --help` in the terminal

3. Use [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) to start the server.

    > [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) is a little supervisor script for nodejs. It runs your program, and watches for code changes, so you can have hot-code reloading-ish behavior, without worrying about memory leaks and making sure you clean up all the inter-module references, and without a whole new require system.

    `package.json` file add:

    ```json
    "supervisor": "0.4.x"
    ```

    Also modifying "scripts" "start" command to use `supervisor`

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node_modules/.bin/supervisor app"
    },
    ```
    We are doing a couple things here:

      1. We are using [npm scripts](https://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html): This allows us to start the server using the command `npm start`
      2. We are using the local `supervisor` script that will be present in the `node_modules/.bin` directory after we run `npm install`

3. Update modules

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the server

    ```
    npm start
    ```
    For more information npm scripts please read [npm scripts](https://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html)

5. View your creation

    http://localhost:3000
