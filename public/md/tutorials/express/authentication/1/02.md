### Setup
#### Creating an express app

1. Install express

  ```
  npm install express -g

  ```

2. Initiate a new app

  ```
  express --sessions storeski
  ```

  This will create the foundation for your application. For complete list of express option type `express --help` in the terminal 

3. Use [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) to
   start the server.

  > [node-supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) is a little supervisor script for nodejs. It runs your program, and watches for code changes, so you can have hot-code reloading-ish behavior, without worrying about memory leaks and making sure you clean up all the inter-module references, and without a whole new require system. 

  `package.json` file add:

  ```
    "supervisor": "0.4.x"
  ```

  Also modifying "scripts" "start" command to use `supervisor`

  ```
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node_modules/.bin/supervisor app"
    },

  ```
  We are doing a couple things here:

    1. We are using [npm scripts](https://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html): This allows us to start the server
       using the command `npm start`
    2. We are using the local `supervisor` script that will be present
       in the `node_modules/.bin` directory after we run `npm install`

3. Update modules

  ```
  npm install
  ```

4. Start the server

  ```
  npm start
  ```
  For more information npm scripts please read [npm scripts](https://npmjs.org/doc/scripts.html)

5. View your creation

  http://localhost:3000
