## Structuring Code

[Meteor][] makes it easy to get started quickly with it's simple file
structure. This works great for small projects, but when creating a
larger project it is helpfull to provide more of a structure. [Meteor]
will automatically separate and compile all file in the `client` directory for use on
the client and all files in the `server` directory for use on the
server. Any file that is nested in the client directory will only be
available to the client. To take advantage of this feature we will use
the following folder structure.

```
client/
  lib/          # shared js files that we will be using
                # on the client
  routes.js     # client routes
  views/        # template files
    app.html    # the base app html / handlebars template 
    app.js      # the base app template events and helpers
lib/            # for scripts that should be run on both the client and
                # the server
models/         # models that are available to both the `client` and the
                # `server`
server/
  startup.js    # auto start scripts for the server
styles/
  app.css       # base css files
tests/          # a place for tests will be ignored by both the `client`
                # and the `server`
```
